EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE is a highly integrated and interactive web-based platform that is capable of running many of the standard analyses that biologists require for viral, bacterial/archaeal, and metagenomic samples. EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE is a highly integrated and interactive web-based platform that is capable of running many of the standard analyses that biologists require for viral, bacterial/archaeal, and metagenomic samples. EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

EDGE provides the following analytical workflows: quality trimming and host removal, assembly and annotation, comparisons against known references, taxonomy classification of reads and contigs, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results (e.g. JBrowse genome browser), and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs can be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results.},\r\n  doi          = {10.21769/bioprotoc.2622},\r\n  institution  = {Los Alamos National Lab.(LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)},\r\n  url          = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1357891},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{forestier2017finding,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Laurent Riffaud and Pierre{-}Louis H{\\'{e}}naux and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  journal   = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},\r\n  title     = {Finding discriminative and interpretable patterns in sequences of surgical activities},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  month     = {oct},\r\n  pages     = {11--19},\r\n  volume    = {82},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/artmed/ForestierPSRHJ17.bib},\r\n  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n  publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\r\n  timestamp = {Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:53:31 +0200},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2017.09.002},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{forestier2017discovering,\r\n  author    = {Germain Forestier and Fran{\\c{c}}ois Petitjean and Pavel Senin and Fabien Despinoy and Pierre Jannin},\r\n  booktitle = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine - 16th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, {AIME} 2017, Vienna, Austria, June 21-24, 2017, Proceedings},\r\n  title     = {Discovering Discriminative and Interpretable Patterns for Surgical Motion Analysis},\r\n  year      = {2017},\r\n  editor    = {Annette ten Teije and Christian Popow and John H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n  editor    = {James Kijas},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@InProceedings{rupp2015identification,\r\n  author       = {Rupp, Rachel and Foucras, Gilles and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Allain, Charlotte and Portes, David and Bouchez, Olivier and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola},\r\n  booktitle    = {22.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\\% and 78\\%, respectively. Only 0.24\\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},\r\n  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n  editor    = {Niyaz Ahmed},\r\n  publisher = {Public Library of Science},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299},\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{johnson2009experiences,\r\n  title={Experiences with hackystat as a service-oriented architecture},\r\n  author={Johnson, Philip M and Zhang, Shaoxuan and Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={University of Hawaii, Honolulu},\r\n  year={2009}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@article{senin2008dynamic,\r\n  title={Dynamic time warping algorithm review},\r\n  author={Senin, Pavel},\r\n  journal={CSDL Technical report},\r\n  year={2008}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Article{ming2008draft,\r\n  author    = {Ray Ming and Shaobin Hou and Yun Feng and Qingyi Yu and Alexandre Dionne-Laporte and Jimmy H.

Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91%and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24%of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005299","editor":"Niyaz Ahmed","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005299"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2012recognizing","properties":{"title":"Recognizing recurrent development behaviors corresponding to Android OS release life-cycle","author":"Senin, Pavel","booktitle":"SERP'12 - The 2012 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice","year":"2012"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"maza2013comparison","properties":{"author":"Maza, Elie and Frasse, Pierre and Senin, Pavel and Bouzayen, Mondher and Zouine, Mohamed","journal":"Communicative &Integrative Biology","title":"Comparison of normalization methods for differential gene expression analysis in RNA-Seq experiments: A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes","year":"2013","issn":"1942-0889","number":"6","pages":"e25849","volume":"6","doi":"10.4161/cib.25849","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","subtitle":"A matter of relative size of studied transcriptomes"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"rupp2013fine","properties":{"author":"Rupp, Rachel and Senin, Pavel and Sarry, Julien and Bouchez, Olivier and Foucras, Gilles and Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola","booktitle":"64.

Ruminants show natural variability in their predisposition to mastitis, and therefore provide unique models for study of the genetics and physiology of host response to bacterial infection. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a dairy sheep population for milk somatic cell counts as a proxy for mastitis. Fine mapping, using whole genome sequencing, led to the identification of a mutation in the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 gene (socs2). This mutation was shown to cause a loss of functional activity of the SOCS2 protein, which suggested impairment of feedback control of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways in susceptible animals. Additionally, size, weight and milk production were increased in animals carrying the susceptible variant suggesting a pleiotropic effect of the gene on production versus health traits. Results gave strong evidence of the role of SOCS2 in the host’s inflammation of the udder and provided new insights into the key mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629","editor":"James Kijas","publisher":"Public Library of Science","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005629"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"phdthesis","label":"senin2015software","properties":{"title":"Software Trajectory Analysis: An empirically based method for automated software process discovery","author":"Senin, Pavel","year":"2015","school":"University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"senin2015time","properties":{"author":"Senin, Pavel and Lin, Jessica and Wang, Xing and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold P. and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2015, Brussels, Belgium, March 23-27, 2015","title":"Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression","year":"2015","editor":"Gustavo Alonso and Floris Geerts and Lucian Popa and Pablo Barceló and Jens Teubner and Martı́n Ugarte and Jan Van den Bussche and Jan Paredaens","pages":"481–492","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Senin0WOGBCF15.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2015.42","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:45 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2015.42"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"article","label":"aube2016impact","properties":{"author":"Johanne Aubé and Pavel Senin and Olivier Pringault and Patricia Bonin and Bruno Deflandre and Olivier Bouchez and Noëlle Bru and Edurne Biritxinaga-Etchart and Christophe Klopp and Rémy Guyoneaud and Marisol Goñi-Urriza","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","title":"The impact of long-term hydrocarbon exposure on the structure, activity, and biogeochemical functioning of microbial mats","year":"2016","issn":"0025-326X","month":"oct","number":"1-2","pages":"115–125","volume":"111","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.023","publisher":"Elsevier {BV}","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16305690"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"inproceedings","label":"wang2016rpm","properties":{"author":"Wang, Xing and Lin, Jessica and Senin, Pavel and Oates, Tim and Gandhi, Sunil and Boedihardjo, Arnold and Chen, Crystal and Frankenstein, Susan","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, {EDBT} 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016, Bordeaux, France, March 15-16, 2016","title":"{RPM:} Representative Pattern Mining for Efficient Time Series Classification","year":"2016","editor":"Evaggelia Pitoura and Sofian Maabout and Georgia Koutrika and Amélie Marian and Letizia Tanca and Ioana Manolescu and Kostas Stefanidis","pages":"185–196","publisher":"OpenProceedings.org","bibsource":"dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org","biburl":"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edbt/Wang0SOGBCF16.bib","doi":"10.5441/002/EDBT.2016.19","keywords":"Database Technology","language":"en","timestamp":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:08:53 +0100","url":"https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2016.19"}}},{"type":"@bibtex/object","data":{"type":"techreport","label":"chain2017edge","properties":{"author":"Patrick Sam Guy Chain and Karen Walston Davenport and Po-E Li and Chien-Chi Lo and Yan Xu and Pavel Senin and Migun Shakya and Sanaa Afroz Ahmed and Theron C.
