<p>I have graduated from the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory, UH Manoa ICS, where Professor Philip M Johnson advised me. The focus of my dissertation research was on empirical software process discovery. Working on this, I have proposed, designed, and developed the Software Trajectory Analysis (STA) framework &ndash; a general approach for recurrent behavior discovery from systematic measurements of software process and product artifacts (i.e., &ldquo;software telemetry&rdquo;). Given a contrast set of measurements (collected from two or more processes), STA leverages the SAX-VSM algorithm and outputs a set of software process-characteristic behaviors for each of the input classes.</p>
<p>I currently work as a principal data scientist at Sanofi, where I participate and conduct RWE studies that accelerate rare disease diagnostics and developing a causal RWE toolkit.  Before that, I worked at Western Digital on next-generation computational non-volatile storage. I also spent time consulting in France as a part of Altran and Tessella &ndash; I worked with Airbus, Liebherr Aerospace, Schneider Electric on various data science-related projects. During my postdoctoral appointment at Los Alamos National Laboratory, I worked on an award-winning EDGE Bioinformatics platform developing microbiome analysis tools, participated in an exascale computation project (ECP), and was extending my dissertation research on recurrent behaviors discovery towards spatio-temporal data mining.</p>
<p>While in school, I worked for MIAT INRA on transcriptome annotation refinement, analysis of structure and function of microbial communities, identifying disease-related SNPs, and identifying transcripts and pathways involved in the fruit ripening processes. At INRIA, I worked on the olfactory proteins computational identification for lepidopteran pests mating disruption. I also worked for DOE-JGI supporting genome finishing effort, pioneering single-cell sequencing process design, and database development. At RCUH, I worked on the first transgenic genome assembly (papaya).</p>
